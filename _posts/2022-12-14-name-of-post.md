Well this is not the start of my Github account or even my Jekyll Blog which has primarily been a way for me to keep an updated Resume to share with prospective employers.  I still believe that will be a major use for this platform but I'd like to start doing something more with this.

I often take notes in markdown as I work and learn.  This has been useful to me as it helps organize my work and serves as useful reminder of what I have learned along the way.  I will start sharing what I can here. Let us see how this site evolves as I start transcribing those notes which are publishable.
