# [Colorado Springs Technology Social Club - meetup](https://www.meetup.com/colorado-springs-technology-social-club/)

Welcome! This is a social club for folks who are broadly interested in tech and want to socialize with fellow tech workers and enthusiasts in the Colorado Springs area. We meet in-person, once per month, to socialize and share. Especially now that so many of us work remotely, it is important to meet up with peers that allow us to build a sense of community and social connection in the area in which we live. We're still figuring out the format and locations, but we'd love to have you hang out with us.
