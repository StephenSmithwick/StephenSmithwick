`jq` is a fast streaming json parser which can transform well formatted json.  I find it useful to:

1. Explore json data of any size. For large files jq is often the fastest way to view the data. Use `jq -C` to output with ANSI color code and `less -R` to accept them.
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -C | less -R
```
2. Isolate a particular part of repeating elements. Use `jq -r` to output the raw results.
`.` is the top level of the json object.  
`[]` starts addressing each object in the array individually.  
`.FIELD_SELECTOR` selects a field.
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[].type' \
| sort | uniq
```
3. Select results.  
`|` pipes results to the next step like unix pipes.  
`select(BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION)` applies the boolean expression to each element and keeps only `true` results
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq '.[] 
      | select(.type == "PushEvent") 
      | .payload.commits[].message'
```
4. Map results.
`| [.FIELD_SELECTOR1, .FIELD_SELECTOR2]` creates an array with the results of each selector
`| @tsv` formats output as a tab seperated table (See also `@csv`, `@json`, `@uri`, `@base64`)
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[] 
      | select(.type == "PushEvent") 
      | .payload.commits[]
      | [.author.email, .sha, .message]
      | @tsv'
```
