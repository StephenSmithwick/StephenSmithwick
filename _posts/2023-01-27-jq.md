`jq` is a powerful unix tool which is great for parsing json data

`echo '{"test": true}' | jq`
```json
{
  "test": true
}
```

`jq` can help you explore json data.  You can easilty format and view any json data by piping the results to less:
`curl -s https://healthdata.gov/resource/g62h-syeh.json | jq -C | less -R`

Helpful for shell scripts jq can filter and select particular parts of json data:

To select the covid data for a particular state for instance:
`curl -s https://healthdata.gov/resource/g62h-syeh.json | jq '.[]| select(.state=="WA")'`
