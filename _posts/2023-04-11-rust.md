## Installing rust:

Using Rustup
```zsh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Note: It is also possible to install rust via `homebrew` however `rustup` is the community receommended approach which installs receommended tools and allows for multiple versions of rust on the same computer.
