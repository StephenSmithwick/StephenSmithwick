      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>Steve is a technical director who quickly assimilates new technologies and information. He is a strong leader who delivers strategic business results.</p>
      <p>Steve is an advocate of Agile development because of its collaborative approach to solving problems. By working closely with users to define a set of requirements which are then continuously tested and released on a fortnightly basis, it is possible to ensure the users requirements are showcased early and often. This no surprises approach ensures the best possible outcome for all stakeholders.</p>
      <p>His enthusiasm for Agile development is contagious. He introduced and developed an agile workflow at RateCity. RateCity uses Agile techniques to create, prioritise, track and follow user stories and projects.  Daily stand-ups provide an opportunity for the team to collaborate and share with the team about their current progress.</p>
      <p>Steve is a passionate Test Driven and Behaviour Driven Developer (TDD/BDD). He believes that by defining functional requirements and translating these into continuous and automated tests it is possible to mitigate risks, ensure that bugs are identified before release and that the product always meets the specified requirements.</p>
      <p>He has excellent organisational, interpersonal and business communication skills with the flexibility required to adjust to rapidly changing schedules and shifting priorities.</p>

      <h3>Lead Developer / Senior Developer</h3>
      <p>Dius Computing	May 2011 - December 2015</p>

      <p>Dius is an Agile consulting business which focuses on delivering products for its customers in a collaborative, iterative and build-measure-learn way.</p>

      <h4>Key projects</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>ResMed's Apnea Link to Care (ALC)</dt>
        <dd>Steve is the lead developer for the ALC project, part of ResMed's EasyCare Online offering. This product allows doctors and Health Management Organisations (HMOs) to diagnose and manage patients with sleep apnea. This is a global project with Steve working closely with teams based in Germany and San Diego.</dd>
        <dd>Working with UX designers, Steve facilitated user workshops to develop requirements. These were refined through user testing of early iterations. This ensures a solution which addresses requirements in a user friendly manner.</dd>
        <dd>Key to this project is the ability to quickly analyse patient data and draw conclusions. Steve reviews reports created to ensure that they represent patient outcomes. He also developed a tool to assist the team in quickly spotting discrepancies within data reported. Given the large volume of information and the small likelihood of error it would be difficult to identify many of these issues manually. Instead, Steve segregated the anomalies and identified their characteristics allowing a tool to be developed.</dd>
        <dd>Steve uses business burn down charts to understand the capability of his team and how they are tracking towards project milestones. This enables him to identify where there is capacity to develop extra features or to identify mitigating actions where there is a risk to meeting a milestone.</dd>

        <dt>Whitepages</dt>
        <dd>Consulting at Macquarie University, Steve led development of a staff directory and hierarchical charts using a bespoke data source.</dd>
        <dd>Steve set up an automated system which enabled this project to be continuously tested and deployed. This automated system ran successive tests including unit and acceptance testing. Upon passing these tests, the build server automatically deployed the application for User Acceptance Testing before wider release.</dd>

        <dt>Chronos</dt>
        <dd>Steve led development of the Chronos reporting tool which collates data from various databases and highlights key information to exam schedulers and students.</dd>
        <dd>As part of this project, Steve coached a team of Macquarie developers in TDD/BDD Agile practices. For example, he introduced Standups, Retrospectives and Showcases to the team. These practices enable a continual health check of the project and helped the team meet deadlines and achieve a high quality product.</dd>

        <dt>Zerobots</dt>
        <dd>The Zerobots project was established to reduce the time it takes to set up software projects by automating the creation of Java and Rails projects in Github. Zerobots creates Continuous Integration Environments which are managed by a build server and deployed automatically on application generated Cloud servers. Steve and his team developed an innovative approach to reduce the average set up time to less than an hour. Previously, teams experienced set up times of up to 14 days.</dd>

        <dt>EasyCare Online (ECO)</dt>
        <dd>The ECO application is a medical patient management and reporting system that allows ResMed to monitor patients and their use of therapy devices wirelessly and via a card.</dd>
        <dd>Key to this project was understanding the highly regulated environment that ResMed works within. In the USA, for example, development has to meet FDA standards. In France, a log of all users accessing patient data has to be created and stored. By developing a framework and tests in consultation with key stakeholders, Steve quickly became a Subject Matter Expert and helped ensure that all regulatory requirements can be monitored and met.</dd>

      <h4>Key projects</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>DIBS</dt>

        <dt>Fox Sports-Crew</dt>
        <dd>Fox Sports uses a number of offsite contractors who need to communicate regularly with the Fox Sports team. Steve worked with key stakeholders to develop a secure website to facilitate communication.</dd>

        <dt>PMG Names</dt>
        <dd>Different sports teams are referred to by many different names which can cause confusion within the Fox Sports business. Steve developed a tool which used contextual information to identify the correct team. This was used in the Fox Sports news ticker and other automated services.</dd>

      <h3>Founding Member Random Hacks of Kindness</h3>
      <p>Sydney	2011 - present</p>
      <p>Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative encompassing a community of over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries making the world a better place by developing practical, open source technology solutions to respond to some of the most complex challenges facing humanity.</p>
      <p>Dius Computing was keen to bring RHoK to Sydney and, in 2011, Steve set up and ran the first weekend hackathon. This has since been followed by several RHoK events. As part of his RHoK work, Steve has worked with charities to define their problems, organised hackathons and worked with volunteers to ensure that projects are effectively deployed.</p>
      <p>During a recent RHoK event (June 2014), Steve and other volunteers worked with the Blue Mountains Bush Fire Crisis team and Sydney University to develop a tool to assist people who have been affected by a disaster.  Over the course of a weekend, the team developed a program which allows users to share their personal data with aid agencies, the police, the ATO etc. using a QR code.</p>
