    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>Steve is a technical director who quickly assimilates new technologies and information. He is a strong leader who delivers strategic business results.</p>
    <p>Steve is an advocate of Agile development because of its collaborative approach to solving problems. By working closely with users to define a set of requirements which are then continuously tested and released on a fortnightly basis, it is possible to ensure the users requirements are showcased early and often. This no surprises approach ensures the best possible outcome for all stakeholders.</p>
    <p>His enthusiasm for Agile development is contagious. He introduced and developed an agile workflow at RateCity. RateCity uses Agile techniques to create, prioritise, track and follow user stories and projects.  Daily stand-ups provide an opportunity for the team to collaborate and share with the team about their current progress.</p>
    <p>Steve is a passionate Test Driven and Behaviour Driven Developer (TDD/BDD). He believes that by defining functional requirements and translating these into continuous and automated tests it is possible to mitigate risks, ensure that bugs are identified before release and that the product always meets the specified requirements.</p>
    <p>He has excellent organisational, interpersonal and business communication skills with the flexibility required to adjust to rapidly changing schedules and shifting priorities.</p>

    <h3>Founding Member Random Hacks of Kindness</h3>
    <p>Sydney	2011 - present</p>
    <p>Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative encompassing a community of over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries making the world a better place by developing practical, open source technology solutions to respond to some of the most complex challenges facing humanity.</p>
    <p>Dius Computing was keen to bring RHoK to Sydney and, in 2011, Steve set up and ran the first weekend hackathon. This has since been followed by several RHoK events. As part of his RHoK work, Steve has worked with charities to define their problems, organised hackathons and worked with volunteers to ensure that projects are effectively deployed.</p>
    <p>During a recent RHoK event (June 2014), Steve and other volunteers worked with the Blue Mountains Bush Fire Crisis team and Sydney University to develop a tool to assist people who have been affected by a disaster.  Over the course of a weekend, the team developed a program which allows users to share their personal data with aid agencies, the police, the ATO etc. using a QR code.</p>
