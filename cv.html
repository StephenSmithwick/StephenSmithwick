    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Senior Software Developer at Amazon AWS with significant experience in cloud computing and machine
      learning. Prior to this, I was Principal Software Engineer at Qantas Airlines, working on customer solutions such
      as notifications and insights. I am passionate about my work which mostly involves exploring, innovating and
      implementing key decisions around our solutions. I believe in the importance of agile development which builds
      team excellence through the practice of continuous improvement. I also love to code and learn new technologies:
      from Android Apps for my sons in Kotlin to Scala courses and meetups, I happily geek out with my team and
      colleagues.

                work
                in progress limit, regular releases, and automation of almost all processes. It was an agile,
