# StephenSmithwick.github.io

My personal github page for Stephen Smithwick.  Deploys as a static site as part of Github Pages.  Uses Jekyl to render markdown sass and html
into personal html pages.  Currently Much of the site is still the out-of-the-box Jekyll site.

## Dependencies
- Ruby 2.7.6
- Jekyll + Ruby dependencies in Gemfile

## To build locally
- Install ruby 
  - I recomend first installing rbenv + rbenv-gemset via homebrew (`brew install rbenv rbenv-gemsets`)
  - from the project directory: `rbenv install`
- Install Jekyll `bundle install`
- Start serving local content `bundle exec jekyll serve`


Currently Available:
- CV/Resume

Planned:
- Quick introduction to interesting projects in my github repositories.

Thanks for taking a look :)
